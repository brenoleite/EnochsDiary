**snip**:: Cures 1 point of damage. ^onelinedescription




When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1 point of damage.
Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
