*Mass heal *enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the Target: ability damage, blinded, *confused, *dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, *feebleminded, *insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 250 points at 25th level.
*Mass heal *does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore permanently drained ability score points.
If used against an undead creature, *mass heal *instead acts like *harm*.
