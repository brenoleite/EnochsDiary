The deity of valor, Heironeous (high-roe-nee-us), appears as a tall human male with coppery skin, auburn hair, and amber eyes. He wears a suit of exquisite chain mail and carries a longsword. He wages war against evil of all sorts, especially his half-brother and nemesis, Hextor.

#### **Dogma**

Heironeous expects his followers to uphold the highest ideals of chivalry and justice and to treat adversity as a challenge to be met and overcome, just as evil should be overcome. The world is a dangerous place where those who fight for justice and who protect the weak and the innocent face a never-ending series of challenges. He exhorts his followers to act honorably at all times, and to uphold the virtues of justice and chivalry with deeds, not just words. Those who face danger with certainty and calm will prevail against evil, Heironeous advises. The Arch-paladin’s teachings have been codified in a chivalric code known as the Heironean Code.

**The Heironean Code**

The Heironean Code consists of three sets of duties:

-   Duty to the People. This duty stresses courage, justice, mercy, valor, protection of the weak, and faithfulness to church superiors or officers of righteous law.

-   Duty to the Arch-paladin. This duty stresses obedience to Heironeous himself, devotion to the church, generosity, championing good against evil, putting the needs of the church and the faith above those of mortals.

-   Duty to a Lady. This duty pertains to the concept of courtly love, devotion to one’s beloved, and respect toward all women in general.

**Scriptures**  

A number of holy texts are venerated by the faith of Heironeous. The best-known work is likely The Book of the Code, a four-chapter work outlining the Heironean Code and providing examples of how one is expected to follow it. Another well-known work is the Book of Penitence (also known as the Just Book), which describes the achievements of Praetor, a legendary paladin who is now venerated as a saint by some Heironean sects.

#### **Clergy and Temples**

The religious hierarchy of Heironeous is organized like a military order. It has a clear chain of command, lines of supply, and well stocked armories.  
  
Clerics of Heironeous fight against worshipers of Hextor whenever they can and spend the rest of their time protecting the civilized lands from the threats of evil. Older clerics work as judges, strategists, and military instructors. The church as a whole is very militant, always championing some cause or embarking on a crusade to against evil or injustice. Though some find their high ideals and intense devotion to their cause a little intimidating, the church of Heironeous is widely admired. This admiration comes mostly because the followers of Heironeous battle genuine evils, usually with little thought of monetary reward. “Glory is the reward for defeating evil, while virtue is the reward for upholding the tenets of Heironeous,” say the clerics.  
  
Heironeous’s clerics also oppose clerics of Hextor wherever and whenever they can.  
  
Temples to Heironeous always have a slightly militaristic look to them. In unsettled areas, they double as fortresses. Even in settled or urban areas they usually contain open, grassy courtyards where soldiers can train.
