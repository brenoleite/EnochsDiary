# [[Personagens/Pelor\|Pelor]]
**Greater God (Neutral Good)**  <span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![pelorSymbol.png](/img/user/files/pelorSymbol.png)</span></span>
Pelor is the creator of many good things, a supporter of those in need, and an adversary of all that is evil. He is the most commonly worshiped deity among ordinary humans, and his priests are well received wherever they go. Rangers and bards are found among his worshipers. His title is the Shining One.

**Portfolio:** Sun, light, healing.  
**Domains:** [[DNDSRD/35eSRD/Spells/Cleric Domains/GLORY DOMAIN\|Glory]], [[DNDSRD/35eSRD/Spells/Cleric Domains/GOOD DOMAIN\|Good]], [[DNDSRD/35eSRD/Spells/Cleric Domains/HEALING DOMAIN\|Healing]], [[DNDSRD/35eSRD/Spells/Cleric Domains/STRENGTH DOMAIN\|Strength]], [[DNDSRD/35eSRD/Spells/Cleric Domains/SUN DOMAIN\|Sun]].  
**Cleric Training:** Because Pelor's clerics spend a lot of time tending to the sick, blessing crops, and providing for the basic spiritual needs of their communities, they attract a number of earnest, forthright youths who want to make the world a better place. While not unduly harsh, training among the followers of Pelor is rigorous enough to send many well-meaning youths back to their farms and cobbler-shops.  
**Quests:** More so than adherents of any other faith, the followers of Pelor often find themselves striving against the undead. They also undertake healing whenever they can—whether that healing is physical or spiritual. Quests that break up a cabal of necromancers, broker a peace accord between rival warlords, or destroy an ancient lich-queen once and for all are good examples of missions for the glory of Pelor.  
**Prayers:** Pelor's prayers often take the form of first person affirmations, such as "I am merciful, just as the Sun of Mercy shines on me."  
**Temples:** Temples to Pelor are tall structures that often feature large windows, often with decorative stained glass. They're a good source of healing magic and often easy to find because Pelor-worship is so prevalent in civilized lands.  
**Rites:** As befits a sun god, Pelor's major festivals take place on solstices and equinoxes, and many weddings and rites of passage take place on the cusp of a new season. The Blessing of the Sun-Kissed Field is a common rite requested by farmers.  
**Herald and Allies:** Pelor uses a solar as his herald. Allies are hound archons, astral devas, and planetars.  
**Relics:** Dawnstar, shard of the sun.
